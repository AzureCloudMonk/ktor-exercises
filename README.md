# Ktor Exercises

## Exercises

To get started, you can start doing a `Hello World` application to familiarize yourself with the basic structure
of a Ktor application. We provide a basic skeleton in [/exercises/skeleton](/exercises/skeleton) for you to
get started:
 
* [Exercise 0: Hello World](/exercises/exercise0-hello-world.md)

Once you are familiarized with it, you can do the following exercises (no specific order required):

* [Exercise 1: HTML DSL, POST and Sessions](/exercises/exercise1.md)
* [Exercise 2: HTML DSL, Typed Routes and Asynchronous Code](/exercises/exercise2.md)
* [Exercise 3: Creating a Reverse Proxy](/exercises/exercise3.md)

## Solutions

We provide solutions for the exercises in the case you have troubles while doing them or just want
to compare your approach with another possible implementation:  

* Solution 0: Hello World *(TO DO)*
* Solution 1: HTML DSL, POST and Sessions *(TO DO)*
* Solution 2: Typed Routes and Asynchronous Code *(TO DO)*
* Solution 3: Creating a Reverse Proxy *(TO DO)*
